## Machine Learning: Classification

### Description
* Implemented Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization and Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization to build a linear classifier for classifying positive and negative reviews using the Amazon Baby Products Reviews dataset. Plotted the Precision and Recall trade off against different threshold values for a review to be labeled as positive.
* Implemented Decision Trees with ADA Boosting to classify safe and risky loans using the Loan Lending Club dataset.
