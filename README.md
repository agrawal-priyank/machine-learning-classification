## Machine Learning Classification: Amazon Product Reviews and Loan Lending Prediction Models

### Description
* Implemented logistic regression with l2 regularization and stochastic gradient descent optimization to build a linear classifier for classifying positive and negative reviews using the Amazon Baby Products Reviews dataset. 
* Plotted the precision and recall trade-off against different threshold values for a review to be labeled as positive.
* Implemented decision trees with ADA boosting to classify safe and risky loans using the Loan Lending Club dataset.
